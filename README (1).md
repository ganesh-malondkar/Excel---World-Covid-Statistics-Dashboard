**Objectives of Dashboarding**
- Solve 10-15 self-formulated Problem Statements over the Dataset
- Make use of different charts to provide clear and crisp fact-telling
- Use creativity and design sense to make a visually appealing and dynamic Dashboard
- Develop Insights and provide Final Conclusion

**Dataset Source**

The data was picked up from the following Kaggle page 

[COVID 19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/georgesaavedra/covid19-dataset)
